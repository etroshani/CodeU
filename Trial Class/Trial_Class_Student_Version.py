#   Your first code! 


####   Introduction to Comments:    #### 
#   If a # is added before a code, it will be ignored when the code is executed. This is used to add descriptions to your code.



####   TASK 1: python as a calculator   ####
#   Additions and Substractions


#   Multiplications


#   Divisions



####   TASK 2: Python as a drawing pad using TURTLE module  ####

#import TURTLE -->  TURTLE is a module designed to showcase your code in a more interactive and visual way. This was created
#                   for younger coders to visualize their code. It allows you to draw on a drawing pad using code as directions.



####    Your first drawing: The OLYMPIC RINGS!  ####

#   1) import module - We need to import our module to be able to use it in our code


#   2) Create a turtle pen. This will allow use to give it commands and directions. Here we are calling it 'pencil'.
#      You can name whatever you like.


#   3) Let's move our turtle.


#   4) We can change the pen size.


#   5) Let's set a starting point. We use penup() to remove our pen from the drawing boad to be able to move it to a different
#      location without it drawing. We then use pendown() to place it back on the board so can start drawing again.


#   6) Let's draw our first circle with the function .cricle()! The number inside the parentheses () will be the size. 
#      Here the size is 50. We also assign the color BLUE to our circle.


#   7) Once the circle is drawn, let's move to a different location.


#   8) We can now draw a second circle! Here we assign the color black to our circle.


#   9) Let's make the pen move once again. Don't forget to use penup() and pendown() whenever you need to move the pen without
#      it drawing on the board.

#   10) Go ahead and draw a third circle


#   11) Let's move to the fourth circle. Here, we have to rotate the pen for it to go in the direction we want. 
#           --- pencil.left(180) or pencil.right(180) ---> This turns the pen perfectly to the opposite side(behind it).
#           --- pencil.right(90) ---> This turns the pen perfectly to the right of it.
#           --- pencil.left(90) ---> This turns the pen perfectly to the left of it.


#   12) We can now draw our fourth circle


#   13) Let's move the pen for our last circle


#   14) We can now draw our final circle!!!
