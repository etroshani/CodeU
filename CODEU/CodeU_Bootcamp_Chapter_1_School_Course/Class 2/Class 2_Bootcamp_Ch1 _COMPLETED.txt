#Welcome to your 2nd CODEU class!


####    FIRST PART    ####

# Recap of last classes material: Fun facts, theory, etc.

####    SECOND PART   ####

##   1. Your first code!    ##

#   Code 'Hello World' and other possible Strings using print().
#   A String is defined by a sequence of characters and is surrounded by quotation marks. Example: "Hello", "abcd", "a3f1g3", ":)", etc...
print("Hello World")

#   Defining a variable
x = "Hello World"
print(x)

#   Overriding a variable
x = "Hello"
x = "I'm hungry!"
print(x)

#   Combining Strings
x = "My name is Francis"
y = " I am 50 years old"
z = " and I like fruits!"
print(x + "," + y + z)


##   2. Turning Python into a Calculator!   ##

#   Resolve mathematical formulas using Integers and Floats.

#   An Interger is a whole number, positive or negative, WITHOUT a decimal point.
#   A Float is a number, positive or negative, WITH a decimal point.


#   Additions

# Example 1
print(5+5)

# Example 2
x = 2
print(x + 3)

# Example 3
x = 1
x = x+1
print(x)

# More efficient way to add to variable x
x = 1
x += 1
print(x)

# Example 4
x = 2
y = 3
print(x+y)


##   Substractions  ##  

# Example 5
x = 20
y = 60
print(y-x)

# Example 6 - This will be an error. It is impossible to substract STRINGS
x = "20"
y = "60"
print(y-x)

# Example 7
x = 0.25
y = 0.15
print(x-y)

# Example 8
x = 25
y = 15
z = x - y
print(z)


#   Multiplications

# Example 9
x = 3
y = 4
z = x*y
print(z)

# Example 10
x = -5
y = 6
print(x-y*5)
print((x-y)*5)

# Example 11
x = "50"
y = "50"
print(x+y)




###     HOMEWORK   |    Creating an calculator! ###

# Create a calculator that can do additions, substractions and multiplications. Make sure to greet the user.
#       1) Greet the user using PRINT()
#       2) Addition: Calculate the sum of 123 456 and 876 544. Display the result using print()
#       3) Substraction: Subtract 555 from 10 000 and print the result.
#       4) Multiplication: Multiply 25, 26, and 27 and print the result.
#       5) Thank them for using the your Calculator
