# CodeU
This repository contains all the course material for the different Python coding courses offered by CodeU.

## What we do
CodeU teaches the basic, intermediate, and advanced fundamentals of coding with Python. We cover important concepts such as algorithm manipulation, variables, print statements, conditionals, various types of loops, different types of modules (Ex.: TURTLE), randomization, and functions. The students are paired together to solve problems and complete difficult tasks as a team. They learn to work well together and use each other's strengths to get through challenging obstacles. This course not only teaches students how to become independent programmers, but also focuses on the importance of teamwork and critical thinking in the world of tech.
